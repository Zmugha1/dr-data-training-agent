## Abstract

This case study informs the instructional design practice by adopting an agile and learner-centered approach, focusing on the 70:20:10 learning experience design. The study tackles the persistent training transfer gap, identifying key factors hindering successful implementation. Drawing from established literature, the research aims to transform training programs into drivers of real-world performance improvement. Through collaborative efforts among Learning and Development (L&D) professionals and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), the 70:20:10 learning experience design emerges, empowering organizations to redefine impactful learning experiences. The findings strongly support the positive hypothesis, demonstrating that effective collaboration between stakeholders results in an enhanced 70:20:10 learning experience design, significantly improving training transfer.

**Research questions:**
1. Why is there a training transfer gap in the target case context?
2. How can training transfer be improved by using lessons learned from extant literature?
3. How can L&D professionals effectively collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs) and managers to design the 70:20:10 learning experience?

## Key Definitions (from Dissertation)

- **Learning & Development (L&D):** Improving abilities, skills, and work ethic of employees to enhance workplace performance.
- **Subject Matter Expert (SME):** Individual with specialized knowledge in a particular area.
- **Learning Transfer:** Applying learning to improve performance (Pollock et al., 2015).
- **70:20:10:** 70% on-the-job experiences, 20% social interactions, 10% formal training (Lombardo & Eichinger, 1996).
- **Training and Performance Gap:** Difference between KSAs acquired through training and actual job performance.
- **Skills Taxonomy:** Hierarchical framework for organizing skills; **Skills Proficiency Levels:** Classification of proficiency (e.g., Beginner, Advanced, Practitioner, Expert).

---

## Conceptual Framework

- **Analysis and Design focus** (Agile ADDIE): Workplace learning, training transfer, 70:20:10 model.
- **Theories cited:** Baldwin & Ford transfer model; LTSI; Experiential Learning (Kolb); Social Learning (Bandura); Andragogy (Knowles); Situated Learning (Lave & Wenger); Human Capital; Dreyfus skill acquisition; CTA; LTEM.

---

## Methodology (Summary)

- **Design:** Qualitative bounded case study; collaborative inquiry + iterative participatory design (IPD).
- **Case:** Service Desk Analysts in a technology company (Midwest); 42 analysts, 4 managers/SMEs.
- **Instruments:** Discovery Questions (Appendix I), Learner Analysis Survey / LTSI-based (Appendix II), Design Document Template (Appendix III), SME Collaboration Experience Questionnaire (Appendix IV).
- **Analysis:** Thematic analysis; learner personas (Analyst, Advanced Analyst, Senior Analyst); job task analysis (HTA, VTP, CTA, Critical Incident Analysis); skill proficiency levels; 70:20:10 Curriculum Map per Area of Performance (AoP).

---

## Main Findings (Summary)

- **RQ1:** Training transfer gap attributed to inadequate structured training, inefficient skills management, lack of performance measurement tools, limited career development, and bootcamp-style overload (e.g., 200+ slides).
- **RQ2:** Transfer improved by work environment support, LTSI factors, supervisor/trainer involvement, pre/during/post training activities, Dreyfus-aligned proficiency, and investment in structure/support/accountability.
- **RQ3:** Effective L&D–SME collaboration achieved via Design Document (Job Task Table, Skills List, Skill Proficiency Definitions, Observation Checklists, 70:20:10 Curriculum Map); quality collaboration, open communication, and shared goals were critical.
